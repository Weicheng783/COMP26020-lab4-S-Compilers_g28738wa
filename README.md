This is the repository for the COMP26020 Part III lab exercise (Compilers)

Instructions on how to run my code:
in Windows: open command line facility or powershell, enter the following script:

python 26020s2lab1.py input.txt output.txt
OR
python3 26020s2lab1.py input.txt output.txt

I am assuming you can do the same in the Linux system.
